# User_activity_analysis
This a SQL PHP project that displays the table contents from the database in a webpage.

One can view the Recent Activity of the users, the detailes of posts such as likes,comments,shares and also view top 3 the users with the most followers (note that all this data is present in the database meaning none of the data is taken directly from the social media platforms).

The project also offers the option to add and delete users from the webpage itself and these chamges can be seen in the database also.
